### Getting Started 🚀

To get started, simply fork this repository and modify the contents of the config.py file:

```python
USER_INFO = {
    "name": "ryanbgm",   # <------ Replace with your Bangumi username

    # Ensure that the total number of anime you've watched exceeds cols x rows
    "cols": 10,          # Number of columns
    "rows": 4,           # Number of rows
}
```

Once you've updated the configuration, sit back and let the GitHub Action work its magic! ✨ After the action completes, you'll find your personalized anime watchlist image in the status.svg file, with the titles arranged in chronological order.

### Customization 🎨

Dive into the main.py and utils.py files to take your watchlist customization to the next level. Modify these files to filter anime titles based on your preferred criteria or genres, ensuring that your list perfectly aligns with your taste. 🎯

For even more control, explore the `type_filter` and `img_filter` functions in the utils.py file. These powerful tools allow you to fine-tune your anime selection, creating a watchlist that is tailored just for you. 🎛️

By default, the script automatically filters out anime that you've put on hold or dropped, based on the `CODE_CONFIG["anime_type"]` setting in the config.py file. This feature gives you a clean and focused view of your active watchlist, so you can start optimizing your list right away! 🚀

### Adjusting Update Frequency ⏰

If you want to change how often the SVG file is updated, simply modify the cron expression in the .github\workflows\python-app.yml file:

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 1" # <------------ mondays at 00:00
```

Customize the cron expression to set your desired update frequency and keep your watchlist always up to date! 📅

### Under the Hood 🔍

This project leverages the official Bangumi API to fetch your watched anime data and utilizes the svgwrite library to generate the SVG image. The combination of these powerful tools allows for a seamless and efficient creation of your personalized anime watchlist. 🧩💡
